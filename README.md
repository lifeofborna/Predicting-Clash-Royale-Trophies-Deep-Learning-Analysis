# Clash Royale Trophies Analysis

In this project, we employ a machine learning approach to analyze and predict the trophy count of players in Clash Royale based on various features such as arena names, clan status, and experience level.

## Overview

- **Data Preprocessing**: We added and processed features like a player's presence in a clan. Categorical and continuous data columns were also processed.
- **Model**: A tabular model was trained using the FastAI library.
- **Analysis**: Post-training, we visualized predictions versus actual values to gauge model performance.

## How Can This Model Help Supercell?

- **Targeted Marketing**: By predicting trophies, Supercell can tailor offers to players based on predicted milestones.
- **Player Engagement**: Predict player progression and design challenges or events that align with their predicted progress.
- **Game Balance**: If certain features heavily influence trophy count in unpredicted ways, game balancing can be reevaluated.
